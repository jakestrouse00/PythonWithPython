# Recreate Class

## Overview
The `recreate_class` function is designed to dynamically recreate a Python class based on a dataclass decorated with `@dataclass` from Pydantic. It extracts the class's arguments, functions, and base classes to generate a programmatic representation of the class. This is useful for code generation, refactoring, or automatic recreation of classes in different contexts.

## Usage
To use this script, you need to have a dataclass decorated with `@dataclass`. Then, pass this class to the `recreate_class` function to generate a dynamic representation.

### Example
```python
from pydantic.dataclasses import dataclass
from PythonWithPython import recreate_class

@dataclass
class MyClass:
    x: int
    y: str

# Recreate the class programmatically
generated_class = recreate_class(MyClass)

# The generated_class will be a PythonClass object containing all details of MyClass
print(generated_class)
# The PythonWithPython syntax for MyClass
print(generated_class.preview())
```
This will generate a programmatic representation of MyClass with its arguments and methods.
