## PythonCode Class

### Overview
The `PythonCode` class is designed to manage and format lines of Python code. Each instance represents a line of code with an optional comment. This class is particularly useful when dynamically generating Python code, ensuring that the code is well-formatted and comments are included properly.

### Key Features
- **content**: The main Python code as a string. It automatically strips unnecessary whitespace, newlines, and tabs.
- **comment**: An optional comment associated with the line of code. If provided, it is appended to the code as an inline comment.
- **preview**: This method provides a string representation of the `PythonCode` instance, useful for debugging and inspecting the generated code.

### Usage

#### Creating a PythonCode instance
To create a PythonCode instance, simply provide the code content and, optionally, a comment:
```python
from PythonWithPython import PythonCode

code = PythonCode(
    content='print("Hello, World!")',
    comment='This prints a message'
)
```

#### Previewing the PythonCode instance
The preview method can be used to generate a string representation of the code, which is helpful for debugging:
```python
print(code.preview())  # Outputs: PythonCode(content='print("Hello, World!")', comment='# This prints a message')
```
